# DRIVER-HEALTH-CHECKING-AND-CONDITION-ASSESSMENT-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-IOT
Roadaccidents are a serious and common problem, often caused by drivers’ poor health. While the IoT-based health assessment systems are widely used in the
healthcare sector, but they are not yet well fitted for vehicles sector or drivers’ safety. To solve the problem, this paper proposes an IoT-enabled health checking system that checks a driver’s health before they start driving. The system uses several sensors such as MAX30102 for pulse and oxygen saturation (SpO2), MLX90614 for body temperature, and MQ3 for real-time alcohol level detection. It also includes a reaction time test to measure responsiveness. The data from these sources is analyzed by machine learning models trained on real driver records, classifying drivers as Fit, Caution, or Unfit. Among the algorithms evaluated, the Support Vector Machine(SVM) achieved the highest accuracy at 97.3 percent. The system also features an ESP32-based wristband for real-time pulse-rate monitoring of the driver’s, Live location tracking, smoke/gas level detection, and an SOS emergency button for extra safety in the case of emergency. By integrating these features, the system provides apractical and flexible way to check driver health condition and enhance road safety.
